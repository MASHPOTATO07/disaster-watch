# Disaster Online Reporting Application - Web Admin Panel

**Disaster Online Reporting Application (DORA)** version 4 is an Android-based [mobile application](https://github.com/ChickenCombo/disaster-online-reporting-application) that allows users to easily and quickly report disasters in real-time. With this app, users can provide critical information about the disaster, including its location, type, and images allowing emergency responders to emergency responders to quickly and effectively respond to the situation. This app also allows users to receive real-time updates about the disaster and any relevant safety information.

The **Disaster Online Reporting Application Web Admin Panel** is used by Local Government Units to view and manage disaster reports. A disaster map displaying user posts represented by disaster markers is visible to administrators and can be used for dispatching disaster response.
